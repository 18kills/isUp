# isUp

### Work in Progress

Checks what IP addresses on your network are up or down             

isUp is a simple program that I will be using in other projects          
This program is to be run on a linux terminal           
 
### How It Works
Firt the program gets the devies local IP address            
Ex: 192.168.0.12          
Then it pings all of the possible IP addresses on that network            
Ex: 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.255           
If the ping from the IP address is recieved then the IP address is up          
When the IP address is up isUp echos the IP address and that it is up
